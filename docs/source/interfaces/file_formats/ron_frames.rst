Precomputed read noise frames
-----------------------------

**Description**: Pre-computed read noise frames for the detector chips for
certain combinations of N combined DITs

**File type**: FITS

**File contents**:

* EXT 0 Meta data
* EXT 1
* EXT 2..N

**Required header keywords**:

* EXT 0 (Empty)::

    STATUS
    ETYPE : RONFRAME

* EXT 2..N (3D Images)::

    Optional
    READTYPE : DC / UTR / FOWLER   # [Double Correlated, Up the Ramp]
    NREADS :                       # Number of read operations

**Required data format**:

* EXT 1 (BinTable)

  A table which information on the read noise characteristics of each extension.

  === ========= ==========
  ext read_type n_read_ops
  int str       int
  === ========= ==========

  where:

  * "ext" is the extension number
  * "read_type" is the read-out scheme, e.g. "double_correlated", "up-the-ramp", etc
  * "n_read_ops" how many read-out operations were performed to generate the
    read noise frames.

* EXT 2..N (3D Images)

  Image cubes (x,y,M) where x,y are the dimensions of the chips on the detector
  and M in the number of independently generated read noise images for a given
  number of combined read-outs. It is recommended to have at least the same number
  of independent read-out frames as number of chips in the detector array so that
  no two detector chips have the same read-out noise pattern.

  If more than one EXT is provided, Each EXT should contain read noise images
  which represent the combined noise for a different combined number of read-out
  operations. E.g. EXT 2 contains read frames for a single read-out operation,
  EXT 3 contains read frames combined from 2 read operations, EXT 4 contains read
  frames generated by combining 4 read operations, etc. By following this scheme
  read frames for the equivalent of 65535 read operations can be generated with
  16 extensions. (Assuming 1s per readout, this is approx EXPTIME = 18 hours)
