SimCADO 1.0 Effect Descriptions
===============================
Useful for the definition of data formats which describe the optical effects of
a certain instrument + telescope configuration

List of effect dimensions
-------------------------
Effects come in either 0, 1, 2, or 3 (2+1) dimensions

* 0D: Single values which aren't associated with a dimension. These are 
  generally values needed by a function, e.g. atmospheric temperature which is 
  needed to calculate the amount of atmospheric diffraction.

* 1D: Single dimensional vectors which act in the spectral range. These are 
  generally descriptions of effects which act in the spectral domain, and 
  therefore contain columns "Wavelength" and "Values", where "Values" can 
  include: "Transmissivity", "Emissivity", "Emission", "Reflectivity".
  Input files will primarily be **ASCII files**

* 2D: Two dimensional spatial effects. There are effects which are independent 
  of wavelength and act purely in the spatial domain. The format is generally a 
  2D image of the effect. The image need not cover the full field-of-view,
  e.g. the kernel of a PSF convolution, however the image may also cover the 
  full field of a detector, e.g. the hot/dead pixel map of a detector. 
  Input files will primarily be **FITS files**

* 3D: (2D+1D) Three dimensional spectrospatial effects. These are spatial 
  effects which have a wavelength dependence. E.g. the diffraction limited PSF 
  core increases with wavelength. Input files will primarily be **FITS files**

Field varying PSFs
++++++++++++++++++
**Description:** Contains PSFs for 1..N wavelengths that are applicable for a 
small part of the field. Each extension should contain a cube with each layer 
containing the PSF for a different region in the field of view. The applicable
on-sky region can either be described in EXT 1 in table format, or with a 
weights map that covers the field of view

**File type**: FITS

**File contents**:

* Ext 0 contains meta data,
* Ext 1 contains either a table or a weights map
* Ext 2..N contains the wavelength dependent PSF cubes

**Required data format**

* EXT 1 (BinTable)

  (N,3) Table with the following columns
  
  ====== ====== =====
  x      y      layer
  float  float  int
  arcsec arcsec none
  ====== ====== =====
  
  where:

  * "x","y" are the centres of the valid regions. SimCADO draws its own map to 
    define where the borders are between these regions
  * "layer" is the position along the M dimension of the PSF cube

  .

* EXT 1 (Image 2D/3D)

  Image cube (x,y,N) with N>=1 layers
  
  Each layer is an image of the whole focal plane (can use much coarser 
  resolution than plate scale) where the pixel values correspond to the PSF layer 
  (from EXT >=2) that should be used in a given region. If there is a different 
  map for each wavelength then number of layers in the EXT 1 cube should equal to 
  the number PSF extensions, i.e. size(EXT 1) = (x,y,N) for a file with N 
  extensions. If there is only one layer in EXT 1, it will be assumed that this 
  weight map works for all wavelengths.

* EXT 2..N (Image 3D)

  N-2 Image cubes (x,y,M) each with M>=1 layers
  
  Each EXT holds a cube with PSFs for a certain wavelength. Each layer (x,y) in a 
  cube is a PSF kernel which is valid for a certain region of the focal plane and 
  for the wavelength given by WAVE0 in the header of each EXT. The location of 
  the valid region is given by the data in EXT 1. 


Spatially constant PSFs

the whole field of view. The data structure will be the same as the field 
varying PSFs.

  header of each EXT.


Spectral Traces
+++++++++++++++

**Description:** A file to hold all of the trace maps for a spectrograph.
The catalogue (EXT 1) connects a single trace to a sky mask (either slit of 
fibre). The traces provide the position on the focal plane where light of a 
certain wavelength will fall.

.. Caution:: 
    Dependency Warning
    
    This number of masks references in the EXT 1 table must be compatible with 
    the number of masks described in the file describing masks. These are
    seperate files as the positions of the masks (in the case of fibres) is not
    always fixed on the focal plane. Hence different spatial configurations 
    for MOS instruments should still reference the same trace layout.

**File type**: FITS

**File contents**:

* EXT 0: Meta data
* EXT 1: BinTable with the catalogue of trace to masks
* EXT 2..N: BinTables, each with a single trace mapping in the detector plane

**Required header keywords**:

* EXT 0 Header (Empty)::

    MASKID      # Mask number that produces the trace
    
**Required data format**

* EXT 1 (BinTable)

  The catalogue table which connects a trace to a mask (slit/fibre). It should 
  contain the following columns:
  
  === ==== ====
  ext name mask
  --- ---- ----
  int str  int
  === ==== ====

  where:

  * "ext" is the extension number (2..N) for the Trace, 
  * "name" is the name of the fibre / order / slit, and 
  * "mask" is identifying number of the slit / fibre in the file containing the 
    description of the slits / fibres

  .
* EXT 2 (BinTable)

  Each extension represents the path of a single spectral trace over the detector.
  There are two types of trace: SLITTRAC / FIBRTRAC. 
  A slittrace preserves the spatial extent of the incoming light and thus 
  describes a series of lines or curves that the projected slit mask will follow
  for different wavelengths. The number of points per wavelength used to trace
  the projection of the slit is unlimited (in theory). SimCADO will recognise the 
  width of the table and calculate how many points are included for the
  polynomial fit
  
  For a SLITTRAC, the table should contain the following columns:
  
  ====== ====== ====== ====== === ====== ====== ======
  lam    s1     x1     y1     ... sN     xN     yN  
  ------ ------ ------ ------ --- ------ ------ ------ 
  float  float  float  float  ... float  float  float
  micron arcsec mm     mm     ... arcsec mm     mm
  ====== ====== ====== ====== === ====== ====== ======

  where:

  * "lam" is wavelength, 
  * "s" is the position along the slit relative to the reference point of the mask 
    (defined in the mask description file), 
  * "x", "y" are the positions on the detector plane (in mm) of each wavelength.
  
  For a FIBRTRAC, there is no slit dimension, as the fibre scrambles the spatial
  structure of the incoming light. Instead the exiting beam has a certain width.
  The trace table should contain the following columns:
  
  ====== ====== ====== ====== ====== ======
  lam    x      y      dx     dy     ang     
  ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
  float  float  float  float  float  float 
  micron mm     mm     mm     mm     deg
  ====== ====== ====== ====== ====== ======

  where:

  * "lam" is wavelength, 
  * "x", "y" are the positions on the detector plane (in mm) of each wavelength, 
  * "dx", "dy" are the width and height of the fibre beam projected on the focal 
    plane, and 
  * "ang" is the rotation angle of the projected fibre beam w.r.t to the x axis

extent of the distortion in both spatial dimensions. The structure allows for 
wavelength dependent distortions.

In general the transmissivity + reflectivity should equal 1. Emissivity is a 
the coefficient applied to a blackbody emission curve for the optical element.

  A table which information on the read noise characteristics of each extension.

  where:

  * "ext" is the extension number
  * "read_type" is the read-out scheme, e.g. "double_correlated", "up-the-ramp", etc
  * "n_read_ops" how many read-out operations were performed to generate the
    read noise frames.

* EXT 2..N (3D Images)

  Image cubes (x,y,M) where x,y are the dimensions of the chips on the detector
  and M in the number of independently generated read noise images for a given
  number of combined read-outs. It is recommended to have at least the same number
  of independent read-out frames as number of chips in the detector array so that
  no two detector chips have the same read-out noise pattern.

  If more than one EXT is provided, Each EXT should contain read noise images
  which represent the combined noise for a different combined number of read-out
  operations. E.g. EXT 2 contains read frames for a single read-out operation,
  EXT 3 contains read frames combined from 2 read operations, EXT 4 contains read
  frames generated by combining 4 read operations, etc. By following this scheme
  read frames for the equivalent of 65535 read operations can be generated with
  16 extensions. (Assuming 1s per readout, this is approx EXPTIME = 18 hours)
