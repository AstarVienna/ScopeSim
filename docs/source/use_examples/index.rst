5-liner use-case examples
=========================

A series of quick examples illustrating ScopeSim functionality

Users or ScopeSim are encouraged to add to this collection by either opening an
issue or submitting a pull request of GitHub.

Each use-case should ideally be a maximum of
**5 lines of ScopeSim specific code**. Obviously this not a hard and fast rule,
but simply a guideline to avoid introducing too much at once.
Import statements, setup code, etc **does not** count towards the 5 lines.
