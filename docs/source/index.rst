Welcome to ScopeSim's documentation!
====================================

Hello world! This is a test to see if the docs are working on RTFD

There are several packages in the ScopeSim_ ecosystem to be aware of:

* ScopeSim_: The engine behind the whole simulator
* `ScopeSim Templates`_: A series of helper function to generate on-sky targets
* IRDB_: The Instrument Reference Database, where the instrument packages are
  stored
* AnisoCADO_: For making SCAO PSF cubes that readable by ScopeSim
* skycalc_ipy_: Connects to ESOs SkyCalc server to get atmospheric spectra
