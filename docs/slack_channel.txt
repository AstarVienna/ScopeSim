Dear ScopeSim users, developers, and enthusiasts!

New ScopeSim version

Firstly, we'd like to announce the release of our latest ScopeSim version (v0.4).
This version contains an updated version of the long-slit spectroscopy mode, as well as various updates to how Source objects can be defined (FITS cubes, lone FITS images).
As always the new version is available via pip:

pip install --upgrade scopesim

ScopeSim Slack channel

It's finally reached a point where multiple teams are now using, or will soon start to use ScopeSim.
Indeed ScopeSim has reached a point where I think it is mature enough that we can start building a community around it.
My hope with this (yet another) Slack channel is that we can bring everyone together, both developers and users, in such a way that we can all start to help and learn from each other.
Not only would this hopefully enable quicker responses to your user questions (i.e. not every query has to go through the Vienna team), it should also hopefully help to expand the developer base for ScopeSim.
Much like the astropy community, it would be great to be able to engage, and indeed profit from the wealth of instrumentation experience within the community.
