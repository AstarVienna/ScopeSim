We currently don't know much about licences, nor have we thought about them.
No doubt, this will change in the future. For the moment though:

We invoke the licence of honour. Ask yourself, what would Thor do?

If ambiguity ensues, ScopeSim will use the GNU GPLv3 software licence.

TLDR; Give credit where credit is due, and reuse this licence.
